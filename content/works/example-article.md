# Welcome to My Works

This is an example work to demonstrate how the works system works. You can write works in Markdown format with frontmatter metadata.

## Features

The works system supports:

- **Markdown formatting** - Write in standard Markdown
- **Frontmatter metadata** - Add title, date, and excerpt
- **Automatic sorting** - Works are sorted by date (newest first)
- **Responsive design** - Works on all devices

## Getting Started

To create a new work:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/works/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, and excerpt
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The work will automatically appear on the works page

Happy writing!

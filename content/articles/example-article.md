# Welcome to My Articles

This is an example article to demonstrate how the articles system works. You can write articles in Markdown format with frontmatter metadata.

## Features

The articles system supports:

- **Markdown formatting** - Write in standard Markdown
- **Frontmatter metadata** - Add title, date, and excerpt
- **Automatic sorting** - Articles are sorted by date (newest first)
- **Responsive design** - Works on all devices

## Getting Started

To create a new article:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content/articles/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, and excerpt
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The article will automatically appear on the articles page

Happy writing!

# User Stories

This directory contains user stories for the personal website project. Each story is a self-contained task that can be tackled independently or in sequence.

## Story Order

1. **[01-project-setup.md](01-project-setup.md)** - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. **[01.5-design-system.md](01.5-design-system.md)** - Establish Tom Sachs-inspired design system and aesthetic foundation
3. **[02-navigation-footer.md](02-navigation-footer.md)** - Create navigation and footer components
4. **[03-landing-page.md](03-landing-page.md)** - Build landing page with hero and about section
5. **[04-about-page.md](04-about-page.md)** - Create expanded about me page
6. **[05-articles-system.md](05-articles-system.md)** - Implement articles system with markdown
7. **[06-music-page.md](06-music-page.md)** - Build music showcase page with embeds
8. **[07-contact-form.md](07-contact-form.md)** - Create contact form with Resend integration
9. **[08-polish-deploy.md](08-polish-deploy.md)** - Polish, optimize, and deploy to Vercel

## How to Use

Each story file contains:
- **Description** - What needs to be built
- **Acceptance Criteria** - Checklist of requirements
- **Technical Details** - Implementation specifics
- **Dependencies** - Which stories must be completed first
- **Notes** - Additional considerations

## Workflow

1. Start with Story 1 (Project Setup)
2. Complete stories in order, or work on independent stories in parallel when dependencies allow
3. Check off acceptance criteria as you complete them
4. Move to the next story once all criteria are met

## Design Aesthetic

All stories should maintain the Tom Sachs-inspired minimal, industrial aesthetic:
- Clean, bold typography
- Minimal navigation
- Simple, functional layouts
- Monochromatic or limited color palette
- Industrial/utilitarian feel
